# Problem Statement
# Business Understanding
# A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. Suppose that you have an image of a digit submitted by a user via a scanner, a tablet, or other digital devices. The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image. 

# Objective
# You are required to develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits based on the pixel values given as features.

# Results Expected
# Write all your code in one well-commented R file; briefly, mention the insights and observations from the analysis.
